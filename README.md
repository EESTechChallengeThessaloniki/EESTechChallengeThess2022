# EESTech Challenge Thessaloniki 2022
This repository contains the basic material and data used during [EESTech Challenge](https://eestechchallenge.eestec.net/) Thessaloniki 2022.</br>

- <b>Topic</b>: Machine Learning Applications
- <b>Sub-Topic</b>: Covid-19 Severity Prediction & Common Cases
- <b>Goal</b>: Build machine learning models capable of predicting the severity of the Covid-19 infection of a patient and group patients that appear to have common symptoms.
- <b>Dataset</b>: `covid-data.csv`
- <b>Tasks</b>:
	1. Preprocess the initial data in order to extract the appropriate information that will be used in the machine learning models. You may use any preprocessing technique(-s) you desire.
	2. Apply one or more classification algorithms in order to be able to predict new, previously unknown, patients into the infection severity according to his/her symptoms.
	3. Apply one or more clustering algorithms in order to group patients that appear to have similar symptoms during their infection with Covid-19.
- <b>Info</b>: More info about the challenge and the respective tasks may be found in the `Tasks Description.pdf` file.
